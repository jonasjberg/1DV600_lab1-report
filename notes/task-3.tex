\section{Task 3 -- Project Plan}\label{task-3-project-plan}

\subsection{Instructions}\label{instructions}

\begin{quote}
Write a project plan for the project. This project plan should show the
way to the complete and finished application, something that you should
be able to follow. Write as much as possible in the project plan, add
the milestones from Assignment Overview, and update the document
throughout the course when you know more in the later assignments.
Again, as an addition, write down your reflections on creating a project
plan. This reflection should be about 100 words.
